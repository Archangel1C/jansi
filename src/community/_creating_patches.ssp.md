We gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune or fix
${project_name} in some way.

### Submitting patches

The easiest way to submit a patch is to create a new issue at our [Issue
Tracker](${project_issue_url}), and provide a 
[Github pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
so that we can review it.
